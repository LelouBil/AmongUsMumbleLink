# AmongUs Mumble Link

CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK WITH LATEST AMONG US

I'm waiting for the release of MelonLoader v0.3 with 32 bit apps support and will rework this as a mod.

Small program that gets the player's position and feeds it to Mumble for positional audio.

Also check out Impostor, the dedicated among us server with plugin support

## How to use

 - download mumble
 
 - configure positional audio like so

 - Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/LelouBil/AmongUsMumbleLink/releases/latest)


 - Extract it somewhere accessible (keep the .exe and the .dll together)
 
 - Run the .exe AFTER the game has finished launching
 
 - Wait a bit and look at the mumble chat for "AmongUsLink is enabled"
 
 - ???
 
 - enjoy not hearing people that are far away
 
## Known issues

Sometimes the app doesn't reset the coordinates when a game ended, just relanch it.
